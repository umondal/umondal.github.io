A Senior Software Developer specializing in modernizing applications and Application Architecture Design on Microsoft Azure.
I thrive on leveraging C# and Angular to build robust, scalable APIs that transform complex requirements into efficient, high-impact solutions.
When I'm not architecting the next cloud-native system, you can find me enjoying a good game of football or spending quality time outsideâ€”always ready to apply that same analytical focus from the screen to the field.
